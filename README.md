# Visual Studio setup

The original colors in the Visual Studio application are very contrasting. My eyes are tired in my long work. I have set My colors for myself, but it is difficult to find places where it stands. So I did my job and I present it in the drawing. 

Maybe this drawing will be useful to you.
